    Youâ€™ll need up a brief proposal that describes the problem you want to solve. We expect submissions to be around 2-5 pages and include at four components:

    # The Problem:
    What problem do you want to solve? Why is it a problem? Who does it affect? What will solving the problem enable? This section should include a brief summary of existing work, such as other packages. If you are proposing a change to R itself, you must include a letter of support from a member of R core.

    # The Plan:
    How are you going to solve the problem? Include the concrete actions you will take and an estimated timeline. What are likely failure modes and how will you recover from them?

    # How Can The ISC Help:
	* What can we do to help you?
	* If you need money, how much (budget proposal)?
	* How will you spend it?
    We expect that most of the budget will be on people, but we will  consider funding travel and equipment if you have good justification.
	* How can we help promote your project?
	* How else could we help?
    Please note that the budget for the ISC is currently limited. We are likely to fund one or two projects with a budget of $20-30k projects, and handful of projects with budgets of  of $5-10k. We do not pay overhead.

    # Dissemination:
	* How will you ensure that your work is available to the widest number of people?
	* What open source license will you use?
	* How will you host your code so that others can contribute?
	* How will you publicize your work?
	* We encourage you to plan at least two blog posts to the R consortium blog:
	    - once to announce the project, and
	    - one to write up what you achieved.
        * We encourage you to get feedback from the community before formally submitting the grant.
	* You are welcome to email individual committee members to get their informal opinion, and you may want to publicize it more widely to get feedback from the broader R community.

Introduction
============

The Problem
-----------
The documentation system built into core R, hereafter referred to as
the Rd system, has changed little over it's life while many other
languages and tools have surpassed it's ability to document. The
`roxygen2`[@roxygen2] package provides alternative methods of defining
documentation which are translated into Rd.  The package enjoys
phenomenal popularity with much new code documented in this way.  It is
time for a rethinking of documentation, how it is created, stored,
handled and distributed.  There are two aspects of R documentation I
intend to address which will make R an exemplary system for
documentation.

The first aspect is storage. The mechanism of storing documentation in
separate Rd files hinders the development process and ties
documentation to the packaging system, and this need not be so. Life
does not always follow the ideal; code and data are not always
distributed via nice packages. Decoupling the documentation from the
packaging system will allow for more dynamic and flexible documentation
strategies, while also simplifying the process of transitioning to
packages  distributed through CRAN or other outlets.


The second aspect is flexibility of defining documentation. R is a
language of flexibility and preference.  There are many paths to the
same outcome in R. While this has often been a source of confusion to
new users of R, however it is also one of R's greatest strengths.
With packages flexibility has allowed for many contributions, some
have fallen in favor while others have proven superior.
Adding flexibility in documentation methods will allow for newer,
and ideally improved, methods to be developed.


Current State of R Documentation
--------------------------------

The Rd system is the default for documenting R code. This system based
on the \TeX markup language is well defined for distinguishing parts,
but not very manipulable programmatically, especially when edited
for special formatting.  The Rd system has been extended with with
packages such as Roxygen2[@roxygen2] and inlinedocs[@inlinedocs],
which provides some relief.

The `roxygen2` package, takes inspiration from the Doxygen[@Doxygen].
This allows for placing documentation in special comments along with
special tags to denote different types of documentation.  For example
`@title` denotes that the line gives the documentation title.  One area
where `roxygen2` falls short is documentation in place, such as
documenting function arguments next to the declaration of the argument.
The `inlinedocs` package helps with this however it is not tied into
the far more often used `roxygen2` system causing fragmentation. Both
these systems are augments to the Rd system, which is fundamentally
limited in it's aspirations.

One system that we can take advice from is the `knitr` package
[@knitrManual; @knitrBook; @knitrCollection].  This package has changed
the literate programming paradigm for R, changing the standard for
documents from Sweave using tex to Rmarkdown using the more friendly
language of Markdown or CommonMark[@commonmark].


Who should care
---------------

All R users that both create and consume functions, packages, classes,
and data should care as all these objects should have documentation.
Within organizations this can be particularly poignant, as code is
rarely packaged but nearly always required to be documented. My
proposal opens options for these organizations. Since essentially all R
users have a stake in documentation it will be important that any
solution to the problem consider the many varied voices in the R
community.


Proposed Solution
=================

Overview
--------
I propose creating an R Documentation Task Force with the purpose of
completing the aims outlined below.

### Aim 1

> We will abstract, document and implement in R a representation for
> documentation of R objects; functions, classes, datasets, etcetera.

The core of the proposal is to define a set of documentation objects
that can be stored internal to R, and manipulated programmatically.
Currently the Rd parser produces an internal format that is tied
closely to the structure of the .Rd source.  In this project we will
abstract, document, and extend the structure of the internal format so
that it becomes the primary target of programming effort.

Part of the abstraction effort will be defining relationships between
documentation types and restrictions on documentation.  Restrictions
will be graded according to severity such that violations can be set to
produce messages, warnings or errors.  The restriction level can be
adjusted according to need and circumstance.  For example, what may be
a warning in an interactive session, would be elevated to an error when
building documentation intended to go into a package.


### Aim 2

> The Task Force will make recommendations for methods, in addition
> to the Rd format, to be supported for converting into internal
> documentation objects. Recommendations will also be made for
> supported formats to convert to directly.


The Task force will decide what languages will be supported for
conversion to and from the internal storage format. We will consider
methods such as Roxygen and Roxygen extended to include inline
comments, for supported methods.  We will evaluate languages such
as Markdown/CommonMark to evaluate if there is sufficient rigor to
form an input method or if portions should be integrated into other
methods, such as if markdown present in comments should be parsed
and converted.

Allowing documentation from multiple sources such as in comments to be
converted to the new internal content-focused storage mechanism, raises
these systems, such as Roxygen, to the same status as Rd documentation,
since the intermediate step of converting to Rd will no longer be
needed.  Allowing users multiple methods of defining documentation,
provides flexibility while also maintaining backwards compatibility
with existing systems. Flexibility in turn allows programmers to
document in the style they are most comfortable with, which makes
documentation easier and more likely to be completed.  Adding
documentation capabilities present in other languages will put R at the
forefront of documentation of code as it is now a leader in literate
programming with knitr.


### Aim 3

> We will impliment the abstraction of documentation according
> to the results of Aim 1.
> According to the recommendations resulting from aim 2,
> we will implement methods to convert from supported sources
> of documentation to newly define documentation objects, and from
> the internal representation to the supported output formats.

The system we propose to implement will allow for multiple inputs and
outputs with the internal representation at the center.  This will
bring all the recommendations of the Documentation Task Force to the
programmer for use.  The system will provide feedback on the
documentation prior to building packages that will assist in
faster development.


Operation of the Task Force
----------------------------

To ensure that all voices with a stake in documentation are heard the
announcement of the project will include an invitation to those
interested to participate.  According to the interest shown final
members may need to be selected.  Any member of the R Core Team,
wishing to participate will be given a seat.  R Core Team members that
have already indicated their intention to participate are listed later
in the proposal.  Additionally, any individual representing an R
Consortium member will be given a seat.  Should interest outside of the
R Core Team and R Consortium members exceed reasonable limits for a
task force, interested individuals will be selected based on experience
in R development and code documentation in consultation with the R Core
Team members participating on the Task Force, while trying to maximize
the coverage of experience in different areas.

In addition to myself Duncan Murdoch of the R Core Team has agreed to
participate on the task force and included a letter of support.
Michael Lawrence of the R Core Team and the R Journal, as well as
others from the R community at large, have expressed interest in
participating.

The task force will work on the principle of consensus, seeking a
solution that all can agree address their concerns[@fisher2011getting].
If there are issues with incompatible solutions where a consensus
cannot be reached the task force will seek outside comments through
blog posts, online polls, and editorials in the R Journal.




Potential Benefits
==================

The are many potential benefits to having an internal documentation
system.  The idea of documentation that can be changes via code fits
very well in the meta-programming ideology of R. While not all benefits
can be foreseen, some can. These examples are not under the scope of
this project, but given as motivation why a more programmatic approach
to documentation is desirable.

For example, at the 2016 UseR! conference there were two systems
presented[@assertive; @checkmate] for run-time parameter checks.
Additionally the `assertthat` package also does run-time parameter
checks.  It is common that significant code is dedicated to checking of
arguments for validity.  Using documentation available in a programmatic
sense that includes information such as allowed classes, length
restrictions, and range or value restrictions one could create a
system that checks all function parameters against all documented
restrictions in one call.  Since the checks are designed off structured
documentation there would be little worry that the restrictions would
not be documented.

Another example and benefit to tool developers such as Rstudio is that
documentation could be queried for information to provide auto-completion
and IntelliSense style help.

I am proposing decoupling documentation from the packaging system. For
organizations that use R internally but do not distribute code as
packages this will allow for documentation of all R work shared withing
the organization.  Even single files passed around can include
documentation that can be extracted and utilized for the benefit of the
recipient.  Additionally, large development shops can utilize design
tools that create documentation which could be imported into R.



Prior Work
==========

At UseR! 2016 international R users conference I presented work I had
done in the direction of extending the R documentation engine.  The
work is contained in the `inlinedoc` branch of the `lint` package
available on github[@lint:inlinedoc].  This implementation has
facilities for in context documentation of function, a class system for
representing documentation, the ability to extract documentation from
source files, methods for printing documentation in either Rd or
markdown formats, and classes for attaching documentation to functions
that assist in printing documentation to the console.  This work has
not been released to CRAN because it is incomplete.  The work provides
an important proof of concept, however decisions were made unilaterally.
The Task Force will first seek to create an abstraction of documentation
needed for R objects, then create an implementation of that abstraction.


Considerations for the Task Force
=================================

The following is a non-exhaustive list of issues that the documentation
task force would provide input for.

Class system
------------
There are several class systems in place in R: S3, S4, Reference Classes
, and R6 [@Rmethods; @R6].  Each provides advantages and disadvantages.
The test force will need to decide on the important features for
storing documentation and ultimately decide on the Class system that
will be used to internally represent documentation inside R.

Storage mechanisms
------------------
In lint I attach documentation directly to the function or object to
which the documentation pertains.  When a package is built and loaded
the attributes are stripped from functions, which would negate the
benefit of attaching documentation directly.
An alternative would be similar to the class system where there is a
central repository of documentation that is called on as necessary.
This has the disadvantage of problems from renaming and could be seen
as going against the principle of proximity.
For either solution for storing documentation there are many
considerations that should be accounted for: performance, memory usage,
and loading times, just to name a few.

Appropriate methods of documentation
------------------------------------

Consider the problem with in context documentation.
Many programs are written as follows:

```r
hello_world <-
function( greeting  = 'hello',
          recipient = 'world'
        ){...}
```

however how is one to interpret the documentation when added:

```r
hello_world <-
function( greeting  = 'hello', #< The greeting
          recipient = 'world' #< Who to
        ){...}
```

Should this be allowed, as it is in Doxygen, with the documentation for
the greeting be after the comma or should this be an error with
recipient having two documentation lines as the R
parser interprets the `#< The greeting` to belong to the parent
expression that contains recipient.  The current implementation
in lint circumvents the problem by placing the comma at the beginning
of the line.

```r
hello_world <-
function( greeting  = 'hello' #< The greeting
        , recipient = 'world' #< Who to
        ){...}
```

No user should be expected to be forced into putting
commas at the beginning of a line, yet behavior consistent with the
R parser and language definition is also desired.


Dissemination
=============

All work produced by the documentation task force will be available
online and to the public. The R Documentation Task Force will create a
github account for the development of code, and storage of meeting
notes.  All tools and packages created will be licensed under the GPL
Version 2, the same license base R uses.  Documentation, such as
meeting notes and design diagrams, will be licensed under a creative
commons attribution and share alike license.

The wider R community will be made aware of the documentation task
force via blog post to the R-Consortium blog.  I will also announce the
project on the R-announce, R-package-devel, and R-devel mailing lists.
An article summarizing the recommendations of the documentation task
force and developed tools will be submitted to the R Journal.  The R
Journal does not publish on a time table that would be amenable to
announcement of the project.

How the R Consortium can help
=============================

By sponsoring this project the R Consortium will give much needed
attention to the project.  Additionally the consortium has access to
members of the consortium sponsors, and contacts with the R community
at large to ensure that the interests are represented. Recommendations
of additional members to include on the task force is appreciated.  I
am asking for funding to cover salary for the programming work to
implement the system as well as travel to the 2017 R users conference
to presenting the recommendations and the system.


Budget
------

I am requesting $10,000 of funding for the following reasons:

* $3750 for travel to R Users Conference 2017 in Brussels, Belgium to
  present the recommendations and system as outlined above, and
* $6250 in salary support for programming the internal representation
  of documentation and converts.

Work hours dedicated to the administration of the R Documentation Task
Force will be supported by the University of Utah Population Health
Research Foundation for Discovery (letter of support included).
